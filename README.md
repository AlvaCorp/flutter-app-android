Flutter For Android Devices
===========================


Overview
--------
**Flutter** Working from our successful Arts & Bots project, we are developing a new creativity-oriented educational technology targeting elementary education. This application is designed for Android OS (minimum SDK version 18).


Development Environment
-----------------------
To grab the repository, be sure to perform a ```git clone --recursive``` as this project utilizes the [MelodySmart Module for Android](https://github.com/CMU-CREATE-Lab/melodysmart-module-android). Android Studio should link the module properly upon first launching. The library requires ```minSdkVersion``` of at least 18.

This document was last written for Android Studio version 2.2.0 using Gradle version 2.14.1.
